## Visas

Entry requirements in Japan vary by nationality. For complete information on Visa requirements, visit Japan's [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/). For exempt countries, including the United States and much of Europe, the standard visit allowed is 90 days.

## Arrival & departure

## Money
While most retailers in large cities accept credit cards, many small businesses and restaurants are cash only. ATMs are commonly available in convenience stores, and traveling with a no-fee debit card (e.g. Charles Schwab) makes getting cash easy. Some larger chains (like Lawson) have enabled tap to pay via preloaded cards, like the transit-oriented [Suica card](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/pass/suica.html).

## Bathing

Some campgrounds offer showers (free or pay), but the best option for bathing -- by far -- is the local onsen. They can be found in big cities and tiny towns, and often for just a few hundred yen offer an opportunity for shoewring, soaking in hot baths, and often saunas and cold plunges. Some provide soap, some sell it, and some are BYO (ditto towels). The best cycling days are those that end at an onsen. Each onsen will post rules to observe (no cell phones, wash before soaking, etc), which should be observed. Bonus bathing opportunities: some towns and rest areas provide free outdoor foot baths.
