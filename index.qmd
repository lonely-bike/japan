Japan is an extremely safe country with amazing opportunities for bicycle touring
at all levels. The locals are friendly, the roads are great, and the drivers are
almost *too* conscientious. There are plenty of gravel and MTB trails if you
want to get off the pavement. Free camping is everywhere. All of these
factors make Japan a particularly good option for cyclists on their first
international trips. Several bicycle tour operators are available if you don't
want to do your own logistics, but this guide aims to make self-supported
touring easy. ...And if things go sideways, there's always the train.

* @brianthelion -- It all started in 2008 with a big overland vehicle called BiRT
  and a bunch of rock climbers. Then somehow bikes got involved.
